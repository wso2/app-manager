<h1>The WSO2 Application Manager 1.0.0 Released!</h1>

<p>
    The WSO2 Application Manager team is pleased to announce the release of version 1.0.0 of
    the Open Source Application Manager.
</p>

<p>
    WSO2 Application Manager is a platform for creating, managing, consuming and monitoring
    Applications. It employs proven SOA best practices to solve a wide range of Application
    management challenges such as Application provisioning, Application governance, Application security
    and Application monitoring and Single Sign On. It combines some of the most powerful and
    mature components of the WSO2's state-of-the-art Carbon platform to deliver a smooth and
    end-to-end Application management experience while catering to both Application publisher
    and Application consumer requirements.
</p>

<p>
    WSO2 Application Manager is comprised of several modules.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Application Provider:</b> Define new Applications and manage them</li>
    <li><b>Application Store:</b> Browse published Applications and subscribe to them</li>
    <li><b>Application Gateway:</b> The underlying Application runtime based on WSO2 ESB</li>
</ul>

<p>
    WSO2 Application Manager is developed on top of the revolutionary
    <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/carbon">WSO2 Carbon platform</a>
    (Middleware a' la carte),
    an OSGi based framework that provides seamless modularity to your SOA via
    componentization. This release also contains many new features and a range of
    optional components (add-ons) that can be installed to customize the behavior
    of the Application Manager. Further, any existing features of the product which are not
    required in your environment can be easily removed using the underlying
    provisioning framework of Carbon. In brief, WSO2 Application Manager can be fully
    customized and tailored to meet your exact Application management needs.
