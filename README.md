WSO2 Application Manager
========================

WSO2 Application Manager (AppM) is a powerful platform for creating, managing,
consuming and monitoring web Applications. It combines tried and tested SOA best practices
with modern day Application provisioning, management principles, governing and security
to solve a wide range of enterprise challenges associated with managing many number of
applications (Mobile and Web).

* WSO2 App Manager consists of several loosely coupled modules.
    - Application publisher
    - Application store
    - Application gateway
    - Connected Device Manager

Application Publisher allows Wab or Mobile application creators/publishers to easily
create and publish Applications. The Applications can be managed with strong
governance model which consists od well-established concepts such as versioning and
life-cycles. Application consumers can user the Application Store module to discover
published Applications and access them with controlled, secure and reliable manner.
AppM also provides Single Sign On (SSO) from end for all the applications provisioned
through the Store. Web gateway is built in to the AppM so that the web calls are
routed to the respective backend web application.


WSO2 Application Manager is based on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon [Middleware a' la carte]
framework. All the major features have been developed as reusable Carbon
components.
